# phi_model.py

"""
This script loads the Microsoft Phi-1.5 model, processes predefined prompts,
generates text responses, and then extracts the sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral)
using a sentiment analysis pipeline. It saves the full details in 'phi_responses.txt'
and also writes just the sentiment labels into 'sentiment_summary.txt'.
